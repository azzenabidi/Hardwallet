# hardwallet
An IT Asset management app built with cakephp 3
# Copyright (c) 2016 azzen abidi <azzen.abidi@gmail.com>


# Minimal System Requirements
-
    - HTTP Server. For example: Apache. Having mod_rewrite is preferred, but by no means required.
    - PHP 5.5.9 or greater (including PHP 7).
    - mbstring PHP extension
    - intl PHP extension
   -  composer
   While a database engine isnâ€™t required, we imagine that most applications will utilize one. CakePHP supports a variety of database storage engines:

    - MySQL (5.1.10 or greater)
    - PostgreSQL
    - Microsoft SQL Server (2008 or higher)
    - SQLite 3



# Installation
1. Extract the tarball into a location readable by your web server
2. Execute composer install within the extracted directory
3. import the .sql file to your database of choice
4. update the db connection info in app.php located in the config folder  
6. Congratulation you have successfully setup Hardwallet. Happy coding!

# Disclaimer
Hardwallet is under active development.It's not recommended for production.
Use it at your own risk



# Trouble:

All efforts have been made to ensure the smooth and correct running of this application.
If you find that Hardwallet is behaving abnormaly though, there are 3 options :

1) Turn it off and run away. Not an option I would advise.

2) Write a harsh comment that says how this app is a pile of **** and you can't believe I
even dared to waste your time.. Again, not a great option, but it does make me laugh when I
read some of the stuff.. :-)

3) file a bug  with error type and any other
information you think is relevant, and I'll fix it. Jackpot.

When I find a bug, I crush it. If I don't find it, and you do, and don't tell me, it lives and we all
lose.. I'm not a mind-reader. Or a Computer-reader. I'm not one of the X-Men.
